RAFIKI Pre-Alpha
========
Is a python based program used to repeat certain (complicated) tasks. These tasks offen require control over   
the mouse, and keyboard, and the possibility to "read the screen" (computer vision). Rafiki is programmable in
Python, which means it's simple for new people to learn, and allows for rapid development.

PS: I am on the lookout for a Python programmer to help me out with this project, for free (as it's non-profit).

Rafiki is
--------------
- Open Source (Will be specified later).
- 100% Free.
- Aims to be cross platform (runs on linux & windows!).
- Written in Python 2.7 - The scripts can run in PyPy!


Rafiki aims to be able to
--------------
- Find and read colours on the screen.
- Click or move the mouse
- Read text on the screen (Optical Character Recognition)
- Capture and analyse images on the screen.
- And much more...
Rafiki can also do whatever Python can do, as it uses CPython or PyPy as it's script-engine (interpreter)


Requirements
--------------
- *WxPython* (GUI) ---- http://www.wxpython.org/
- *PIL* (Image manipulation) ---- https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/ 
- *Python-XLib* (IF LINUX) ---- http://sourceforge.net/projects/python-xlib/  

Thats all I remember ATM.
