RAFIKI Pre-Alpha
========
Is a python based program used to repeat certain (complicated) tasks. These tasks offen require control over the mouse, and keyboard, and methods to help you to "read the screen". Rafiki is programmable in Python, which means it's simple for new people to learn, and allows for rapid development.


Rafiki is
--------------
- Open Source.
- 100% Free.
- Aims to be cross platform (runs on Windows and some Linux-distros!).
- Written in (and for) Python 2.7


Rafiki aims to be able to
--------------
- Find and manipulate colours on the screen.
- Use IO-devices like mouse, and keyboard
- Read text on the screen (Optical Character Recognition) - Tesseract
- Analyse and manipulate images.
- And more...
Rafiki can also do whatever Python can do, as it uses CPython as it's script-engine (interpreter)
